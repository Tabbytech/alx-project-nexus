# E-Commerce Backend (Django + PostgreSQL + REST APIs)

This project is part of the **ProDev Backend Engineering Program**, designed to simulate a **real-world backend development environment**.

It emphasizes **scalability, security, and performance** while following modern software engineering practices like version control, documentation, and testing.

## ProDev Backend Engineering Program Overview

The **ProDev Backend Engineering program** equips engineers with practical backend skills by building real-world applications and mastering industry-standard tools.

### Key Technologies Covered

* **Python** → core programming language for backend development
* **Django** → scalable web framework with ORM & built-in security
* **REST APIs** → designing and documenting APIs for frontend consumption
* **GraphQL** → modern API design for flexible queries
* **Docker** → containerization for local development and deployment
* **CI/CD** → automated testing and deployment pipelines

###  Important Backend Concepts

* **Database Design** → relational schemas, normalization, indexing
* **Asynchronous Programming** → handling concurrent requests efficiently
* **Caching Strategies** → reducing latency with Redis and query optimization

###  Challenges Faced & Solutions

* **Performance bottlenecks**: solved with proper indexing (`price`, `category`, `created_at`) and `select_related` queries.
* **Authentication security**: addressed with **JWT tokens** for stateless sessions.
* **Scalable documentation**: implemented **Swagger (drf-spectacular)** for self-updating API docs.
* **Large datasets**: solved with pagination (`StandardResultsSetPagination`) and search filters.

###  Best Practices & Takeaways

* Write **small, descriptive Git commits** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `perf:`).
* Always **document APIs** for frontend and future maintainers.
* Use **Docker Compose** for consistent local environments.
* Follow **REST best practices**: predictable endpoints, filtering, sorting, pagination.
* Performance matters → **optimize queries, cache smartly, monitor logs**.

##  Project Features

1. **CRUD Operations**

   * Products & Categories management
   * JWT-based User Authentication

2. **Advanced Product API**

   * Filtering (category, min/max price, availability)
   * Sorting (price, name, created\_at)
   * Search (name, description, SKU)
   * Pagination for large datasets

3. **Documentation**

   * Swagger UI → `/api/docs/`
   * OpenAPI schema → `/api/schema/`
   * Redoc → `/api/redoc/`

---

## Tech Stack

* Django + Django REST Framework
* PostgreSQL (relational database)
* JWT Authentication (`djangorestframework-simplejwt`)
* django-filter (filtering support)
* drf-spectacular (Swagger/OpenAPI docs)
* Docker & Docker Compose

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-backend.git
cd ecommerce-backend
```

### 2. Run with Docker

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### 3. Apply Migrations & Create Superuser

```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 4. Access Services

* API Docs → [http://localhost:8000/api/docs/](http://localhost:8000/api/docs/)
* Admin → [http://localhost:8000/admin/](http://localhost:8000/admin/)

---

## Authentication

* Get JWT token:

  ```http
  POST /api/auth/token/
  { "username": "yourusername", "password": "yourpassword" }
  ```

* Refresh token:

  ```http
  POST /api/auth/token/refresh/
  { "refresh": "your_refresh_token" }
  ```

Use header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

---

## Example Requests

* **Filter by price & category**

  ```
  GET /api/products/?category=3&min_price=100&max_price=500
  ```
* **Sort by price descending**

  ```
  GET /api/products/?ordering=-price
  ```
* **Search products**

  ```
  GET /api/products/?search=headphones
  ```

---

## Git Workflow

We follow **conventional commits** for clarity:

* `feat:` → new feature
* `fix:` → bug fix
* `perf:` → performance improvement
* `docs:` → documentation update
* `test:` → add/modify tests
* `refactor:` → code cleanup

Example:

```
feat: implement product CRUD API with filtering
perf: optimize queries with select_related
docs: update README with ProDev program overview
```

---

## Roadmap

* [ ] User registration & profile endpoints
* [ ] Order & checkout flow
* [ ] Payment gateway integration (Stripe, PayPal, M-Pesa)
* [ ] Asynchronous tasks (Celery + Redis)
* [ ] CI/CD with GitHub Actions
* [ ] Deployment to Render/Heroku/AWS
